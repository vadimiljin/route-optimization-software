![](https://blog-cdn.route4me.com/2024/06/021fd0ce-what-is-wismo-768x432.jpg)

When customers don’t know where their order is, they often call  customer service to ask for the status, known as WISMO or “Where is my  order?” calls or queries.

These WISMO calls generate a flood of customer inquiries regarding the status and location of their orders.

[According to a report by BenchmarkPortal](https://info2.magento.com/rs/585-GGD-959/images/45146_eBook_Omnichn_Follow the Cust_Delivery Convey_040319.pdf), WISMO queries can account for 30% of customer service calls and cost **$4 – $7 per call**.

That means if you receive 1000 calls per week, 300 of them would be  WISMO. That’s roughly $1200 to $2100 per week and could be more than  $100,000 annually!

These figures underscore the financial impact of WISMO-related inquiries, making it a crucial issue to address.

Such queries not only increase support costs but also significantly impact customer satisfaction.

Customers who don’t know where their order is often feel anxious and frustrated, leading to a negative perception of your brand.

While WISMO calls are often inevitable, you must keep them to a minimum. Think of it as a benchmark for a [reliable delivery experience](https://blog.route4me.com/what-makes-a-great-delivery-experience/).

Too many queries for status updates can overburden your customer  service team, leading to longer waiting times and irate customers, which can affect customer loyalty.

Also, imagine the frustration your support team would feel, dealing  with repetitive questions day in and day out. The situation could worsen during the holiday season when the delivery volume peaks.

So, how can you reduce WISMO queries?

This article shares several strategies and describes WISMO, how it affects the bottom line and more. So, let’s dive in.
